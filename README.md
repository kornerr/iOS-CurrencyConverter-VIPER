# Fork updates

Made a couple of changes to build the project under Xcode 14.0.

# Original

This simple iOS application written in Swift 4 shows how to use VIPER architecture pattern in practice.

It doesn't use any 3rd-party libraries (Cocoa Pods or Carthage). Only iOS SDK libraries and Swift 4.

Later I'll write an article how to implement VIPER from scratch and why we need VIPER and its layers.
